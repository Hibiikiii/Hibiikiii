# Hi there, Leon here! üëã

Right now, I'm working to turn my hobby into a career. I have been passionate about programming since 2016, when I started with Minecraft plugins. During that time, I met a friend, and together with other friends I made along the way, we started our own business. I am currently focusing on game development, as well as creating applications and their designs.

### Current projects üñ•Ô∏è
‚öôÔ∏è Unreal Launcher (still private) - Currently working with [Maxim Bigler](https://github.com/BiiigM) to create a fast launcher only for the Unreal Engine, stripped of the games & store tab from the Epic Games Launcher.  
‚öôÔ∏è eos-API-wrapper (still private) - Currently working with [Maxim Bigler](https://github.com/BiiigM) to fetch data from the API used by the Epic Games Launcher, allowing us to use these values in the Unreal Launcher.  
‚úÖ [tbs-game (school)](https://github.com/Hibiikiii/tbs-game) - This was an addition to a school project to replace a written exam in the Abitur. I will finish the scoring system if I find time.  
‚úÖ [UltimateWindowPolice](https://github.com/Hibiikiii/UltimateWindowPolice) - This is a plugin I made for Unreal Engine after reading through posts on the Unreal Forum. I decided to provide a solution to save data before losing it when a player quits the game or application suddenly.
